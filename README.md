# pyautogui-hello-world
This basic program will create a new text file called 'Hello world' with that text in the document. This happens by following several steps:

1. Opening the Task View Interface and creating a virtual desktop
2. Opening Notepad, located at C:/Windows/System32/notepad.exe
3. Typing "Hello world!" into notepad, then saving the file to the desktop with the date/time in the name
4. Closing the virtual desktop

Three modules are used in this program: os, time, and pyautogui

--------------------------------------

Instructions:
1. Note: This script will only run on Windows 10 machines, as it utilizes keyboard shortcuts 'Win + Tab' followed by 'Win + Ctrl + D' to create a virtual desktop.

2. Install Python 3 (I'm using 3.6) and use "pip install pyautogui" to install pyautogui on Windows
