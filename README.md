# pyautogui-hello-world
This basic program utilizes Python's 'os' command to open a new notepad file. After notepad is open, the Python pyautogui package sends keyboard and mouse commands to the windows. The end result is the computer will type "Hello World!" in Windows Notepad

--------------------------------------

Instructions:
1. Install Python 3 (I'm using 3.6) and use "pip install pyautogui" to install pyautogui on Windows

2. Add a shortcut to Notepad on your desktop, right click the shortcut, go to Properties.
Under "Run", change "Normal" to "Maximized" so the program opens in full screen.

3. In the script below, change the filepath to point toward the shortcut on your desktop.
Be conscious of the / versus \ !
